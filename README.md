# minusshell
## a terminal shell of the future
features: 
- running nodejs apps natively
- full blown package manager
- user system
- easy way to develop apps
- great logging system _(this ones actually cooler than it sounds)_

## how to install it you may ask
well... you need to meet a few dependencies first:
- nodejs (runtime env)
- npm (to get all the libraries)
- git (to make the package manager work)

alright. got all these? great.

now it's the time to actually install this bad boy in steps:
- open a terminal window in the folder you want to install -SH to (on windows it's cmd, on mac it should be just terminal (i'm not a mac person) and on linux you just need to know how the terminal emu is called on your setup because bruh)
- git clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/negative-zero-inft/minusshell`)
- enter the command `cd (directory you downloaded the repo into, by default it should be minusshell)`
- enter the command npm i
- wait a few epochs 
- type node --no-warnings . _(the no warnings is here because the stopwatch is weird)_
- if it asks you to log in just press enter, that will bring you to the user creation "screen"
## congrats! you're a minusshell user now
